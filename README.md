# GPU Benchmarking with Image Classification using ANN

This repository contains code for benchmarking GPU performance in image classification tasks using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We utilize popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch for implementing the image classification models. The benchmarking is done on various GPUs to compare their performance and identify the most suitable hardware for image classification tasks.

## Features

- Implementation of image classification models using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Benchmarking script to evaluate the performance of GPUs.
- Results visualization and comparison tools.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- GPU with CUDA support (NVIDIA GPU recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
